This is a tool to meassure your accounts, finding weakness on gearing, define own playstyle, compare to another people.

## Usage
Use a Fribbel's optimizer export to evaluate your level account.

* Step 1 : Save a .json from save/import tab of the optimizer
* Step 2 : Select a player you want to compare (in process)
* Step 3 : Upload the .json (not stored on any way)
* Step 4 : Press the "Import Button"


The "Don't Show top Speed" checkbox is used if you want to hide that data, uncheck if you want to use it.

## Thanks
Thanks to the guys who let me put their stats on the page for their communities to compare.

* _To Kundalt, my Friend who gives me the initial Idea_
* _To Anl, Lusira, Jenazad, dZanderr, TristenWulf, ExeFalse and all the guys who has shared their stats._
*  _And of course Fribbels for making a tool dedicated to optimize our accounts_
